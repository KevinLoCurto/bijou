# s'Bijou!!
usually there would be some sort of documentation explaining the code in here but i decided to just do that inside of the code itself. go take a look if you're interested! 

## current refactored main code (version 3.0+)

in the folder labeled "scripts" you can find all the current code that i'm working with. all the commented out areas have information about the code, the logic behind it, how it works and experiences i might have made with it. 

## old code (version 2.4)

in the folder "old code" you can take a look at the abomination that was my old game code. you'll quickly realize why the refactoring was absolutely necessary. collisions.js, index.html and style.css are the three documents that are missing, that's because nothing really changed there so it'd be kinda unnecessary.

## refactoring of the old code in update 3.0

the past few months i've been refactoring the entirety of the game's code and now i'm finally done with that. in each of the different sections i'll be noting down in comments how many lines of code were saved. i'll also note it down in a more coherent fashion below.
